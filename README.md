# Introduction

This project was designed in order to provide a Minimal Viable Product Website for my Buildin assocation. It is fully in French as its first edition will take place in France with French-speaking participants.  

I relied on the basic web development skills I acquired during my Masters, on the following tutorial [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [React documentation](https://react.dev/), and ChatGPT.

# Main features

Here are the following features that were necessary to consider the first version of the website done:
- Navbar with logo at the left to go back to home page and questions link at the right,
- A basic home page,
- A button in the home page to register linking to a form to register to the event,
- A footer with socials,
- A questions page to answer basic questions and provide contact info.

# Nice-to-have features

Here are the "features" I'd like to have in the following months:
- A real presentation page introducing the association and its members,
- A contact page,
- A partnership/sponsorship page.
